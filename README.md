Wecome to use FFPlayer!

Before you use it, add dependency:

FFMpeg,

libmp4v2,

The advantage of FFPlayer:

clicking the button or double click the face to  pause,

playing the next file automatically,

controlling playback progress quickly,

audio playback low latency,

optimizing mp4 file, 

less memory usage,

Note:

The previous or next file needs to be set by yourself.
